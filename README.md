# Home Automation with Arduino and Bluetooth

This project implements a voice-controlled home automation system using an **Arduino Uno**, **Relay Modules**, and a **Bluetooth Module**. It allows users to control appliances like lights and fans remotely using Bluetooth commands.

## Components Used
- **Arduino Uno** 
- **Relay Modules** (4-channel or more)
- **Bluetooth HC-05 Module, Sound Sensor**
- **Bulbs, Fans, TV and AC**
- **Jumper wires, Breadboard, and power supply**

## Features
- Control 4 different appliances (Bulb-1, Bulb-2, Bulb-3, and Bulb-4).
- Voice commands sent through a Bluetooth app (or terminal).
- Option to control individual appliances or all at once.
- Also can on/off with clap.
